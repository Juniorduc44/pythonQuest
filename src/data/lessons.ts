// PYTHON QUEST CURRICULUM DATA
// =====================================================================================
// This section defines all chapters and lessons for the Python Quest platform.
// The curriculum is designed to be progressive, building foundational knowledge
// before moving to more advanced topics. Each chapter aims for approximately 10 lessons.
//
// Curriculum Design Principles:
// - Progressive Difficulty: Lessons within chapters, and chapters themselves, increase in complexity.
// - Practical Application: Emphasis on real-world examples and hands-on exercises.
// - Engagement: Content is written to be engaging for a wide audience, from kids to adults.
// - Modularity: Chapters and lessons are self-contained units where possible, allowing for
//   potential future features like custom learning paths or topic reviews.
//
// To add new content (for future expansion):
// 1. Define a new chapter object in the `chapters` array if creating a new chapter.
//    Ensure the `id` is unique and sequential.
// 2. Add new lesson objects to the `lessons` array.
//    - `chapterId` must match the ID of the chapter the lesson belongs to.
//    - `id` should follow the "chapterId-lessonNumber" format (e.g., "5-1" for Chapter 5, Lesson 1).
//    - `difficulty` should be appropriately set.
// 3. Ensure all lesson `content` fields (introduction, concept, example, exercise)
//    are populated with high-quality, accurate, and engaging educational material.
// 4. Test thoroughly by running the application and navigating to the new content.

      introduction: 'Variable scope determines the accessibility of a variable in different parts of your code. Understanding Python\'s scope rules (often summarized by the LEGB rule: Local, Enclosing function locals, Global, Built-in) is crucial for avoiding bugs and writing functions that interact correctly with their environment.',
      concept: '- **Local scope**: Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside it.\n- **Global scope**: Variables defined at the top level of a script or module are global.\n- To modify a global variable from inside a function, you must use the `global` keyword.\n- If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.',

    title: 'The `collections` Module: Specialized Containers',
    description: 'Explore advanced container datatypes like Counter, defaultdict, and deque',
    difficulty: 4,
    content: {
      introduction: 'Python\'s `collections` module provides specialized container datatypes that offer alternatives to the general-purpose built-ins (dict, list, set, tuple). These are useful for specific tasks and can often lead to more efficient or cleaner code.',
      concept: 'Key data structures in `collections` include:\n- **`Counter`**: A dict subclass for counting hashable objects. Elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values.\n- **`defaultdict`**: A dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values. If a key is accessed and not found, the factory function is called to create a default value for it.\n- **`deque`** (double-ended queue): A list-like container with fast appends and pops from both ends.\n- **`OrderedDict`**: A dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added (less critical since Python 3.7+ where standard dicts also remember insertion order).',
      example: {
        code: 'from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque, OrderedDict\n\n# Counter: Count occurrences of items in a list\nword_list = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "apple", "banana", "orange"]\nword_counts = Counter(word_list)\nprint(f"Word counts: {word_counts}")\nprint(f"Most common word: {word_counts.most_common(1)}")\nprint(f"Count of \'apple\': {word_counts[\'apple\']}")\n\n# defaultdict: Group items (e.g., by first letter)\nnames = ["Alice", "Bob", "Anna", "Charlie", "Ben"]\nnames_by_letter = defaultdict(list) # Default factory is list, so new keys get []\nfor name in names:\n    names_by_letter[name[0]].append(name)\nprint(f"\\nNames grouped by first letter: {dict(names_by_letter)}") # Convert to dict for cleaner print\nprint(f"Names starting with Z (default): {names_by_letter[\'Z\']}")\n\n# deque: Efficient appends and pops from both ends\nqueue = deque([1, 2, 3])\nqueue.append(4)       # Append to the right: deque([1, 2, 3, 4])\nqueue.appendleft(0)   # Append to the left: deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\nprint(f"\\nDeque after appends: {queue}")\nright_popped = queue.pop()      # Pop from the right: 4\nleft_popped = queue.popleft() # Pop from the left: 0\nprint(f"Deque after pops (right:{right_popped}, left:{left_popped}): {queue}")\n\n# OrderedDict (maintains insertion order - standard dicts do this since Python 3.7)\nordered_data = OrderedDict()\nordered_data[\'first\'] = 1\nordered_data[\'second\'] = 2\nordered_data[\'third\'] = 3\nprint(f"\\nOrderedDict: {ordered_data}")',
        explanation: 'We demonstrate `Counter` for frequency counting, `defaultdict` for grouping items without checking if a key exists, `deque` for efficient queue/stack operations from both ends, and `OrderedDict` which preserves insertion order (though standard Python dictionaries now also do this since version 3.7).',

    difficulty: 3,
    content: {
      introduction: 'JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format. It\'s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Python has excellent built-in support for JSON via the `json` module, making it straightforward to work with web APIs, configuration files, and data exchange between different systems.',
      concept: 'The `json` module provides two main functions:\n- **`json.dumps(obj, indent=None)`**: Serializes a Python object `obj` (like dicts, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, None) into a JSON formatted string. `indent` can be used for pretty-printing.\n- **`json.loads(s)`**: Deserializes a JSON formatted string `s` into a Python object.\nJSON objects map to Python dictionaries, JSON arrays map to Python lists, JSON strings to Python strings, etc.',

        explanation: 'We start with a Python dictionary `python_data`. `json.dumps()` converts this into a JSON formatted string, `json_string`, with an indent of 2 for readability.
